  <h1>King's Scout Award Progress</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Milestone 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Completing this milestone early helped build momentum for other parts of the award.</li>
      <li>Taking my logbook to every activity made it easier to remember and record everything accurately.</li>
      <li>Logging consistently stopped the work from building up — I recommend updating it after every activity.</li>
      <li>Even though it's optional, it supports other required components and is worth completing.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Milestone 2</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Staying active in my unit through this milestone helped me build leadership and planning skills.</li>
      <li>Experiences here fed directly into other criteria, especially my Adventurous Journey.</li>
      <li>Gave me regular feedback from peers, which helped shape my leadership style.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Milestone 3</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I haven’t completed this yet, but I plan to apply the structure and habits from Milestones 1 &amp; 2.</li>
      <li>I’ll use feedback from past experiences to improve time management and communication.</li>
      <li>Consistency in logging and breaking tasks into smaller parts will help me complete this efficiently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Special Interest Areas (SIAs)</h2>

    <h3>SIA 1 – Swim Club</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chose this for health and fitness — swam twice weekly for 6 months.</li>
      <li>Having access to my school’s squad swimming helped me stick with it.</li>
      <li>Consistency and measurable goals (e.g. number of sessions) made it easy to track progress.</li>
      <li>Fit naturally into my routine, which made commitment easier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIA 2 – Assistant Guide Caving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This matched my passion, so the work felt enjoyable rather than forced.</li>
      <li>Logging cave hours and completing the course was smooth because I was motivated.</li>
      <li>Feedback from Matt Smith gave me guidance on improving navigation and communication.</li>
      <li>Reinforced leadership and risk management skills in real-world scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIA 3 – Traditional Climbing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I had little prior climbing experience — so I did an immersive week-long trip at Mount Arapiles.</li>
      <li>Learning through immersion worked well and helped me make fast progress.</li>
      <li>Feedback from Julie Engelhardt helped me improve route reading and gear use.</li>
      <li>Reinforced the importance of feedback and learning from experts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIA 4 – Upcycling / Art Project (Planned)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Planning to create something hands-on like a shoe rack or a bottle cap mural.</li>
      <li>Chose creative and sustainable themes to stay motivated and explore new skills.</li>
      <li>Will apply lessons from past SIAs (time management, seeking feedback, personal investment).</li>
      <li>Passion for the topic helps with follow-through and quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIA 5 &amp; 6 (Planned)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Will choose skills or interests I’m already passionate about.</li>
      <li>Based on previous experience, personal interest is key to success.</li>
      <li>Will use structured goals and feedback loops like in previous SIAs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Tip:</strong> Choose things you’re genuinely passionate about — it keeps motivation high and the work enjoyable.</p>

    <h2>Outdoor Adventure Skills (OAS) Progression</h2>

    <h3>OAS 1–9</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Completed progressions in all 3 core areas: Bushcraft, Bushwalking, Camping.</li>
      <li>Used the OAS books to break skills into manageable goals.</li>
      <li>Practised regularly at meetings and camps, focusing on skill improvement.</li>
      <li>Treating each step as a personal challenge kept me engaged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>OAS 10–12 (Planned)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As core requirements are done, I can focus these on areas of interest (e.g. ropework, remote travel).</li>
      <li>Will choose skills that connect with caving/climbing to build depth.</li>
      <li>Plan to track progress with the same routine used for OAS 1–9.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adventurous Journey</h2>

    <h3>Planning the Journey</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Finding a qualified mentor (Greg Roberts) made the process clearer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>Mentor feedback helped refine safety documents, route plans, and logistics.</li>
      <li>Realised the importance of early preparation and accurate documentation.</li>
      <li>Planning helped me develop detailed thinking and contingency planning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Leading the Journey</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed the trip to match my group’s abilities — but still faced real-time challenges.</li>
      <li>Learned to adjust expectations and prioritise meaningful goals when plans shifted.</li>
      <li>Flexibility was crucial — not everything can go exactly as planned.</li>
      <li>Leadership meant keeping the group safe, engaged, and motivated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reviewing the Journey</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ran a feedback session immediately after the trip while details were fresh.</li>
      <li>Participants shared constructive feedback:
        <ul>
          <li>Needed earlier communication of plans</li>
          <li>Some days were too physically demanding</li>
          <li>Weather warnings were missed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I used this feedback to set earlier deadlines, monitor weather more closely, and adjust pacing in future planning.</li>
      <li>Helped me improve both planning and communication skills.</li>
    </ul>
